# ez AJAX Shop


Created for Rune-Server.

This is a project where I will constantly be pushing updates, forks etc where I deem fit. This is completely free, the reason why this is on GitHub. License is Mozilla Public License 2.0

Under no circumstances may you re-use ANYTHING (including, but not limited to: snippets of code, sprites or images, (not including those which do not belong to us) for the purpose of selling.

# Features
  - AJAX Based 
  - Smart UI/UX allowing the user to easily do what they want.
  - Nice auto-complete search bar in the top navigation



### JavaScript Libraries

ez AJAX Shop uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AlertifyJS] - Enhanced notifications & alerts for web apps.
* [jQuery] - The ultimate JavaScript simplicity framework.

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Download and extract the [latest release](https://github.com/Brandito24/ezajaxshop).

Place in web root or similar and start the web server/service.





# **For production environments:**
**DO NOT USE IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT!**

Always contact Brandon (original & current author) before deploying this in a production environment.
The project should be thoroughly checked for any possible security issues, including but not limited to:,
- **SQL Injection** (Where a user attempts to do wrong by attempting to escape any parsed string that is used in MySQL)
    To avoid this, either use PDO to connect to your MySQL server, or use MySQLi combined with MySQLi functions to clean your strings
- **XSS Cross-Site Scripting** (Where a user attempts to do wrong by attempting to interfere with any HTML by placing HTML markup inside input that is then to be printed on the page)


### Plugins

In future, I (Brandon) plan to create a plugin system allowing the integration & creation of new user submitted additions


### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

ez AJAX Shop is hosted on GitHub for fast and easy developing.
Push/Merge requests are filtered by Brandon personally.
